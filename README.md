This is a Battleship game generated by gpt and fine tuned with chatgpt and a bit of my brainpower.

The sole purpose of this thing is to build a game for my homeroom for the chapel presentation, and I totally do not have time to learn python whatsoever.
sorry if the whole gpt thing makes you uncomfortable! :(
